Developed by a Fortune 500 company that specializes in selling and leasing servers and data centers to other businesses, the product ensures smooth and robust operations by overseeing clustered enterprise systems.<br/><br/>These systems are interconnected through a complex web of wires and switches, enabling quick resolution of intricate issues while maintaining top-tier service quality.This product isn’t built for the average user—it’s specifically designed for expert power-users and trained personnel in the field. The target audience is highly skilled professionals who know the ins and outs of managing enterprise systems, not general users without technical expertise.</div></div></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">Problem Statement</h1><div class="project-section-description">Let’s talk about the problem statement. The company did have a console in place before, but it fell short in a critical area. While it was capable of storing data, it couldn’t effectively streamline or direct that data to the right channels for meaningful use. <br/><br/>Instead of functioning as an intuitive control panel, it was more like a disorganized storage cabinet with a confusing and inconsistent navigation system.Users found it frustrating to sift through the cluttered interface, struggling to locate and make sense of the information they needed. This inefficiency didn’t just slow things down—it led to missed opportunities for data-driven decisions and hindered overall productivity. <br/><br/>Without a unified system to organize, categorize, and prioritize data, the console wasn’t able to convert raw information into actionable insights. As a result, its potential value remained untapped.</div></div><div class="project-classes"><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Customer Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">Though the main pain lied with the customer and powerusers themselves whom we interviewed. According to the customers: They had to manually request every changes and every concerns plus, they had no way of accessing data dynamically. This led to a huge amount of repetitive requests and replies, which felt redundant and inefficient.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Power User Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">Next we asked the power users, and their concerns were that, With every defects and changes, they had to go through mountain of data to even figure out which one they were looking for. And collaborating with different departments to resolve any issue became a very tiring-manual task.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Overall Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">So the overall consensus was that, Without a proper cohesive system, workload increased for even minute of tasks, workflow became highly complex and the word ‘efficiency’ was near extinct.</div></div></div></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">Proposed Solutions</h1><div class="project-section-description">So the first thing we did to remedy this was to properly define target users. So we created 5 specific personas as the power users who would each have a specific role. such as:</div></div><div class="project-classes"><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona I</h1><img src="images/group-2059419.png" loading="lazy" sizes="230px" srcset="images/group-2059419-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059419.png 510w" alt="" class="image-10"/><div class="project-subtext"><strong>(P1) SMC A.I </strong>being passive admin which handles most of the work in the system also working as a sort of a operating system for the application itself.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona II </h1><img src="images/group-2059420.png" loading="lazy" sizes="230px" srcset="images/group-2059420-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059420.png 512w" alt="" class="image-9"/><div class="project-subtext"><strong>(P2) Bell Rep</strong> engages in back and-forth communication with the customer</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona III</h1><img src="images/group-2059421.png" loading="lazy" sizes="230px" srcset="images/group-2059421-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059421.png 512w" alt="" class="image-8"/><div class="project-subtext"><strong>(P3) Customer Admin</strong>, only creating and tracking orders, managing budget and cost tracking</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona IV</h1><img src="images/group-2059422.png" loading="lazy" sizes="230px" srcset="images/group-2059422-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059422.png 510w" alt="" class="image-6"/><div class="project-subtext"><strong>(P4) Bell Admin</strong> She receives environments to manage from P2 (Asmina), monitors and manages various environments, and applies configurations.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona V</h1><img src="images/group-2059423.png" loading="lazy" sizes="230px" srcset="images/group-2059423-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059423.png 512w" alt="" class="image-7"/><div class="project-subtext"><strong>(P5) Customer Workload Manager</strong> - He requests resources from his main admin, P3 (Kyle), and runs applications on those resources.</div></div></div></div><div class="highlighted-texts">When I design a product, I start with strategy—setting goals, timelines, and roles to align the team. Research follows, where I engage users and analyze solutions to uncover needs and shape personas that guide decisions. Designing personas this way helped us understand who we were designing for and what problems they might face and what kind of remedies we would have to come up with. Throughout, it’s about collaboration, iteration, and keeping the user at the heart of every decision.  </div><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">Road to Success</h1><div class="project-section-description">The next segment, <em>Road to Success</em>, focuses on how we approach the project—planning, strategizing, and figuring out every detail along the way. After some reflection and discussion, I crafted a guiding statement to shape the direction of the entire project:The goal is to transform the existing console from a static data repository into a dynamic, fully-functional control panel. This control panel will centralize tasks for all core personas, bringing their roles together in harmony rather than treating them as isolated functions.This vision aims to foster collaboration and efficiency, making the console a true powerhouse for cohesive teamwork.<br/><br/>To guide our work, I developed six core ideas that serve as our foundation. These ideas help us clearly define the challenges we face, craft meaningful solutions, and transform those solutions into impactful features.<br/></div></div><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344b-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-layout quick-stack wf-layout-layout"><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344c-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">1</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>System for View-Only Command Center Mode</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344d-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">2</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>System for Optimizing Enterprise Network Relations</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-ada7d19a-d0d7-5e29-f073-6d0a132b8008-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">3</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>System for Efficient Enterprise Dispatching</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-f43cb720-26a9-2df5-8078-6a48c2e0f226-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">4 </h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>System for Generating Enterprise Remediation Documentation</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-b192e00a-9534-8f5f-949f-b2979a1231d5-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">5</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>System for Performing an Autonomous Widget Operation</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-_350943ff-13b7-a53f-d563-ed229324666d-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">6</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em>Dynamic Tagging</em></strong></div></div></div></div><div class="highlighted-texts">The goal is to transform the existing console from a static data repository into a dynamic, fully-functional control panel.

This means defining project goals, setting clear timelines, and assigning roles so everyone knows their part. It’s about creating a shared vision through brainstorming and planning, ensuring the team stays aligned and productive.<br/><br/>From there, I dive into <strong>research</strong>, talking directly with users and analyzing existing solutions to uncover real needs and opportunities. This step is crucial for understanding the problem we’re solving and shaping user personas that guide the design decisions.Once I’ve got a solid foundation, I move into <strong>prototyping</strong>. <br/>This is where ideas start to take shape. I map out the structure, build wireframes, and create prototypes to test functionality and refine the experience.<br/><br/>Finally, in the <strong>design</strong> phase, I bring everything to life. I develop cohesive visuals, finalize layouts, and build a consistent design system to tie it all together. For me, the entire process is about collaboration, iteration, and always keeping the user front and center.</div></div><img src="images/frame-203466773.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1882px) 94vw, 1770px" srcset="images/frame-203466773-p-500.png 500w, images/frame-203466773-p-800.png 800w, images/frame-203466773-p-1080.png 1080w, images/frame-203466773-p-1600.png 1600w, images/frame-203466773.png 1770w" alt=""/></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">Case Study video presentation</h1><div class="project-section-description">Here is a presentation of the case study to help you understand better in a non-interactive way.</div><div class="w-embed-youtubevideo"></div></div></div></section><script src="js/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"  ></script><script src="js/webflow-script.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
