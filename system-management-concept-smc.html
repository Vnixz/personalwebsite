Project Strategy</h1><div class="project-section-description">When I approach product design, I start with <strong>strategy</strong>—laying the groundwork for success. This means defining project goals, setting clear timelines, and assigning roles so everyone knows their part. It’s about creating a shared vision through brainstorming and planning, ensuring the team stays aligned and productive.<br/><br/>From there, I dive into <strong>research</strong>, talking directly with users and analyzing existing solutions to uncover real needs and opportunities. This step is crucial for understanding the problem we’re solving and shaping user personas that guide the design decisions.Once I’ve got a solid foundation, I move into <strong>prototyping</strong>. <br/>This is where ideas start to take shape. I map out the structure, build wireframes, and create prototypes to test functionality and refine the experience.<br/><br/>Finally, in the <strong>design</strong> phase, I bring everything to life. I develop cohesive visuals, finalize layouts, and build a consistent design system to tie it all together. For me, the entire process is about collaboration, iteration, and always keeping the user front and center.</div></div><img src="images/frame-203466773.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1882px) 94vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1770px, 1449.949951171875px" srcset="images/frame-203466773-p-500.png 500w, images/frame-203466773-p-800.png 800w, images/frame-203466773-p-1080.png 1080w, images/frame-203466773-p-1600.png 1600w, images/frame-203466773.png 1770w" alt=""/></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">4. User Personas</h1><div class="project-section-description">Unlike most projects where the target user is a single, well-defined individual with a unique personality, this project was a bit different. Here, the product was designed exclusively for power users, and the end goal was shaped entirely by their roles and responsibilities, not their personalities.To tackle this challenge, the first thing we did was clearly define our target users. <br/><br/>We created five specific personas, each representing a distinct power user role. These personas helped us focus on the specific demands and tasks associated with their responsibilities, ensuring the product would truly meet their needs. This approach allowed us to design solutions that aligned directly with their work, ensuring the product was as efficient and impactful as possible.</div></div><div class="project-classes"><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><div class="picture-text"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona I</h1><img src="images/group-2059419.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 230px, 250px" srcset="images/group-2059419-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059419.png 510w" alt="" class="image-10"/></div><div class="picture-desc"><strong>(P1) SMC A.I </strong>being passive admin which handles most of the work in the system also working as a sort of a operating system for the application itself.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><div class="picture-text"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona II </h1><img src="images/group-2059420.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 230px, 250px" srcset="images/group-2059420-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059420.png 512w" alt="" class="image-9"/></div><div class="picture-desc"><strong>(P2) Bell Rep</strong> engages in back and-forth communication with the customer</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><div class="picture-text"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona III</h1><img src="images/group-2059421.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 230px, 250px" srcset="images/group-2059421-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059421.png 512w" alt="" class="image-8"/></div><div class="picture-desc"><strong>(P3) Customer Admin</strong>, only creating and tracking orders, managing budget and cost tracking</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><div class="picture-text"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona IV</h1><img src="images/group-2059422.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 230px, 250px" srcset="images/group-2059422-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059422.png 510w" alt="" class="image-6"/></div><div class="picture-desc"><strong>(P4) Bell Admin</strong> She receives environments to manage from P2 (Asmina), monitors and manages various environments, and applies configurations.</div></div><div class="roject-class-textsalt"><div class="picture-text"><h1 class="project-subhead">Persona V</h1><img src="images/group-2059423.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 230px, 250px" srcset="images/group-2059423-p-500.png 500w, images/group-2059423.png 512w" alt="" class="image-7"/></div><div class="picture-desc"><strong>(P5) Customer Workload Manager</strong> - He requests resources from his main admin, P3 (Kyle), and runs applications on those resources.</div></div></div></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">5. Problem Statement</h1><div class="project-section-description">Let’s talk about the problem statement. The company did have a console in place before, but it fell short in a critical area. While it was capable of storing data, it couldn’t effectively streamline or direct that data to the right channels for meaningful use. <br/><br/>Instead of functioning as an intuitive control panel, it was more like a disorganized storage cabinet with a confusing and inconsistent navigation system.Users found it frustrating to sift through the cluttered interface, struggling to locate and make sense of the information they needed. This inefficiency didn’t just slow things down—it led to missed opportunities for data-driven decisions and hindered overall productivity. <br/><br/>Without a unified system to organize, categorize, and prioritize data, the console wasn’t able to convert raw information into actionable insights. As a result, its potential value remained untapped.</div></div><div class="photo-holder"><div class="project-text-card"><h1 class="project-subhead">Customer Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">The main pain points were experienced directly by the customers (customers being client&#x27;s power user) and power users we interviewed. From their perspective, the process was frustratingly manual and inefficient.<br/><br/>Customers had to submit requests for every single change or concern, no matter how small, and they lacked any <br/>way to access data dynamically or in real time.<br/><br/>This resulted in a constant back-and-forth of repetitive requests and responses, which quickly became redundant and time-consuming. For many, it felt like they were stuck in an endless loop of inefficiency, unable to focus on more critical tasks or make proactive decisions. The system wasn’t just inconvenient—it was a significant drain on productivity and morale.</div></div><div class="project-text-card"><h1 class="project-subhead">Power User Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">When I spoke with the power users, I could see just how taxing the current system was for them. They shared how, every time they encountered a defect or needed to make a change, they had to sift through mountains of data just to find what they were looking for. <br/><br/>It wasn’t just time-consuming—it was mentally exhausting, especially when they were under pressure to resolve issues quickly.On top of that, collaborating with other departments was another major headache. <br/><br/>Even resolving a single issue often meant endless back-and-forth communication and manually coordinating efforts across teams. It was a draining process that left them feeling like they were constantly chasing their tails instead of having a streamlined system to help them work efficiently.</div></div><div class="project-text-card"><h1 class="project-subhead">Overall Pain</h1><div class="project-subtext">The overall consensus was clear: without a proper, cohesive system in place, even the smallest tasks became unnecessarily burdensome. The workload piled up for things that should have been quick and simple, and the entire workflow became a tangled mess of complexity.<br/><br/>Power users felt the strain of this inefficiency daily. What could have been streamlined processes instead required excessive effort, extra steps, and constant manual interventions. <br/><br/>The word <em>‘</em><strong><em>efficiency</em></strong><em>’</em> practically disappeared from their vocabulary, replaced by frustration and exhaustion. It was evident that the lack of a unified system wasn’t just an inconvenience—it was actively hindering productivity and causing significant operational drag.</div></div></div></div><div class="highlighted-texts">When I design a product, I start with strategy—setting goals, timelines, and roles to align the team. Research follows, where I engage users and analyze solutions to uncover needs and shape personas that guide decisions. Designing personas this way helped us understand who we were designing for and what problems they might face and what kind of remedies we would have to come up with. Throughout, it’s about collaboration, iteration, and keeping the user at the heart of every decision.  </div><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">6. Road to Success</h1><div class="project-section-description">The next segment, <em>Road to Success</em>, focuses on how we approach the project—planning, strategizing, and figuring out every detail along the way. After some reflection and discussion, I crafted a guiding statement to shape the direction of the entire project:The goal is to transform the existing console from a static data repository into a dynamic, fully-functional control panel. <br/><br/>This control panel will centralize tasks for all core personas, bringing their roles together in harmony rather than treating them as isolated functions.This vision aims to foster collaboration and efficiency, making the console a true powerhouse for cohesive teamwork.<br/><br/>To guide our work, I developed six core ideas that serve as our foundation. These ideas help us clearly define the challenges we face, craft meaningful solutions, and transform those solutions into impactful features.<br/></div><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344b-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-layout quick-stack wf-layout-layout"><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344c-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">a</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">System for View-Only Command Center Mode</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-eabb399b-15b8-d983-30f3-fb4dfaff344d-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">b</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">System for Optimizing Enterprise Network Relations</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-ada7d19a-d0d7-5e29-f073-6d0a132b8008-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">c</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">System for Efficient Enterprise Dispatching</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-f43cb720-26a9-2df5-8078-6a48c2e0f226-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">d</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">System for Generating Enterprise Remediation Documentation</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-b192e00a-9534-8f5f-949f-b2979a1231d5-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">e</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">System for Performing an Autonomous Widget Operation</em></strong></div></div></div><div id="w-node-_350943ff-13b7-a53f-d563-ed229324666d-0cc1f380" class="w-layout-cell"><div class="project-class-textsalt"><h1 class="project-subhead">f</h1><div class="project-subtext"><strong><em class="text-insidebox">Declarative Engine to Choose Hardware and OS for Workload</em></strong></div></div></div></div><div class="project-section-description">As a core user persona and a passive admin, <strong>SMC AI</strong> embodies the concept of a proactive, intelligent assistant tailored for data center operations.

Existing command centers often log users out after a period of inactivity to maintain security protocols. While this practice is necessary, it disrupts monitoring workflows by Interrupting critical monitoring; Users lose real-time visibility of ongoing system changes and alerts.Delaying reactions to issues: Users need to re-authenticate, wasting precious time in emergencies.</div></div><div class="imagentext"><div class="block1"><div class="textnextto"><div class="text-block-4">Our Solution: View-Only Monitoring Mode, To address these challenges, we proposed a view-only mode for the command center, designed to maximize usability while preserving security:</div><div class="h3-b2"><div class="text-block-3">Persistent Monitoring:</div><div class="text-block-4">The view-only mode allows continuous access to real-time system data and alerts without timing out.This ensures uninterrupted monitoring, particularly in environments requiring 24/7 oversight, such as data centers or critical infrastructure operations.</div></div><div class="h3-b2"><div class="text-block-3">Enhanced Collaboration:</div><div class="text-block-4">The view-only state can be securely shared with other team members.It supports a read-only access level, where sensitive actions like system changes, configuration updates, or command execution are restricted.</div></div><div class="h3-b2"><div class="text-block-3">Controlled Security Transition:</div><div class="text-block-4">If a user needs full access, they can re-authenticate directly from the view-only mode.Upon re-authentication, the view-only session is automatically terminated to prevent redundancy and ensure security.</div></div><div class="h3-b2"><div class="text-block-3">User-Friendly Design:</div><div class="text-block-4">Clear visual indicators distinguish view-only mode from full-access mode, reducing confusion.Notifications or pop-ups can guide users to re-authenticate when trying to perform restricted actions.</div></div></div><img src="images/mask-20group.png" loading="lazy" width="622" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 97vw, (max-width: 767px) 84vw, (max-width: 1919px) 622px, 10vw" alt="" srcset="images/mask-20group-p-500.png 500w, images/mask-20group.png 563w" class="image-11"/></div><div class="h3-b2"><div class="text-block-3">User-Friendly Design:</div><div class="text-block-4">Improved Efficiency: Users no longer experience interruptions in their monitoring duties, ensuring swift responses to system events.Enhanced Security: Sensitive actions remain restricted, maintaining compliance with security protocols.Streamlined Collaboration: Teams can work cohesively, sharing real-time data views without creating access conflicts.Adaptability: The feature is particularly valuable in scenarios where a display is meant for passive viewing, such as wall-mounted dashboards in operations centers.</div></div></div></div><div class="solution-brief-block1"><div class="solution-headngs"><div class="solution-h1"><h1 class="s-n">B.</h1><h1 class="solution-title">System for Optimizing Enterprise Network Relations</h1></div><div class="text-block-2">For number 2, we aimed to optimize enterprise network relationships.Data centers often struggle with complex networks that drive up costs and cause latency. Our solution, through the SMC control panel, creates a unified topology map linking network infrastructure to physical systems.This map helps users better understand their networks, monitor traffic, identify bottlenecks, and optimize configurations, turning data into actionable insights for improved performance and efficiency.</div></div><div class="imagentext"><div class="block1"><div class="textnextto"><div class="text-block-4">Enterprise data centers often operate on a foundation of clustered systems connected by intricate networks of cables, routers, and switches. While this infrastructure supports scalability, it introduces several challenges:<br/><br/>High Costs: Expanding physical networks and maintaining underutilized hardware lead to significant infrastructure expenses.Network Latency: Inefficient layouts and poorly optimized routing increase response times, negatively impacting performance.<br/>Complexity: The lack of a clear, consolidated view of the network and its relationships with physical systems makes troubleshooting and optimization difficult for administrators.<br/><br/><strong><em>Our Solution:</em></strong> Optimized Enterprise Network Relations Through the System Management Concept (SMC). To address these pain points, we proposed incorporating a unionized topology system into the SMC control panel.

Consistency</h1><div class="project-subtext">I developed a consistent UI navigation system that unifies all major functions into a single, cohesive interface. <br/><br/>This design eliminates the inefficiencies and fragmentation of earlier versions, creating a more streamlined workflow. <br/><br/>By centralizing essential tools and features, I ensured users can navigate intuitively and complete tasks more quickly and efficiently. <br/><br/>This improvement significantly reduces the time and effort required, offering a more reliable and effective workflow with everything logically organized and easily accessible.</div></div></div><img src="images/top.png" loading="lazy" width="1437" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1919px) 92vw, 1437px" alt="" srcset="images/top-p-500.png 500w, images/top-p-800.png 800w, images/top-p-1080.png 1080w, images/top.png 1328w"/><div class="photo-holder"><div><img src="images/mockup-1.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1443px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1328px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-1-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-1-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-1-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup-1.png 1328w" alt=""/></div><div><img src="images/mockup.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1443px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1328px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup.png 1328w" alt=""/></div></div><div class="photo-holder"><div><img src="images/mockup-5.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1440px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1325px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-5-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-5-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-5-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup-5.png 1325w" alt=""/></div><div><img src="images/mockup-6.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1440px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1325px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-6-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-6-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-6-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup-6.png 1325w" alt=""/></div></div><div class="photo-holder"><div><img src="images/mockup-9.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 991px) 85vw, (max-width: 1919px) 697px, 456.45001220703125px" srcset="images/mockup-9-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-9.png 697w" alt=""/></div><div><img src="images/mockup-10.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 991px) 85vw, (max-width: 1919px) 698px, 457.1000061035156px" srcset="images/mockup-10-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-10.png 698w" alt=""/></div><div><img src="images/mockup-11.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 991px) 85vw, (max-width: 1919px) 697px, 456.45001220703125px" srcset="images/mockup-11-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-11.png 697w" alt=""/></div></div><div class="photo-holder"><div><img src="images/mockup-7.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1440px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1325px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-7-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-7-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-7-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup-7.png 1325w" alt=""/></div><div><img src="images/mockup-8.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1440px) 92vw, (max-width: 1919px) 1325px, 705px" srcset="images/mockup-8-p-500.png 500w, images/mockup-8-p-800.png 800w, images/mockup-8-p-1080.png 1080w, images/mockup-8.png 1325w" alt=""/></div></div><img src="images/frame-203466822.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 77vw, (max-width: 767px) 85vw, (max-width: 991px) 89vw, (max-width: 1919px) 94vw, 1450px" srcset="images/frame-203466822-p-500.png 500w, images/frame-203466822-p-800.png 800w, images/frame-203466822-p-1080.png 1080w, images/frame-203466822-p-1600.png 1600w, images/frame-203466822-p-2000.png 2000w, images/frame-203466822-p-2600.png 2600w, images/frame-203466822-p-3200.png 3200w, images/frame-203466822.png 6550w" alt=""/></div></div><div class="project-blocks"><div class="project-texts"><h1 class="project-section-heading">Case Study video presentation</h1><div class="project-section-description">Here is a presentation of the case study to help you understand better in a non-interactive way.</div></div><div style="padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo youtube"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/in8Z_dh5Ofc?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" frameBorder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay;
